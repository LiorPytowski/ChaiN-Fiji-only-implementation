The aim of this macro is to classify the chromatin into n classes of equal variance. 

#### FAQ
##### How do I know what parameters to use when running the macro for the first time?
Run the macro with the default settings and make sure to select the options to pause the macro at the end of each file and show all the intermediary results.  
Once you have that, inspect the images and check whether the parameters seem correct. If not, then, for example, try different thresholds then re-run the macro with the newly selected thresholds.  

For visualisation purposes, image synchronisation might be of interest (Analyze › Tools › Synchronize Windows).
